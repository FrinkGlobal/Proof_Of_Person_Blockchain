# Frinks Proof of Person Blockchain
Based off of the #DIYDLT Blockchain that you can build entirely from scratch using C#, .NETCORE, and Visual Studio

## What is written?
* Proof of Work Blockchain
* Miners communicate in a Peer-to-Peer fashion 
* Transactions and blocks propogate through network
* Miners rewarded per block mined

## What is left to do before initial official release of blockchain?
* Switch from Proof of Work to Proof of Person using approved list of ID provide by Frink
* Initial Blockchain Optimization - Logarithmic Trimming of Blockchain headers

## What are short term future plans?
* Miners store their own social networks
* Social networks are analyzed by Frink's Sybil detection algorithm
* Switch to ZeroMQ communication protocol
* Social Network sharding
* Constant improvements to security, performance, and privacy beyond this.
